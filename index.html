            Find light in the beautiful sea<br>
            I choose to be happy<br>
            You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky<br>
            You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy<br>
            When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky<br>

            I knew that we'd become one right away<br>
            Oh, right away<br>
            At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays<br>
            I saw the life inside your eyes<br>
            So shine bright, tonight, you and I<br>
            We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky<br>
            Eye to eye, so alive<br>

            Palms rise to the universe as we moonshine and Molly<br>
            Feel the warmth, we'll never die<br>
